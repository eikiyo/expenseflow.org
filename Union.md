# Complete Database Simplification - Long-term Scalable Architecture

Looking at your schema, you've **over-engineered** it. You have 15+ tables when you only need 5. Here's how to make it much simpler while keeping it scalable.

## **The Problem: Your Current DB is Too Complex**

**Current Issues:**
- 15+ tables for what should be 5 tables
- Multiple audit/logging systems doing the same thing
- Excessive normalization causing performance issues
- Duplicate expense storage (submissions vs expenses vs separate type tables)
- Complex approval chains that are hard to query
- Validation logs that duplicate application logic

## **Recommended Simple Architecture (Best for Scale)**

**5 Tables Only:**
1. `expenses` - One table with JSON for type-specific data
2. `attachments` - File storage
3. `approvals` - Simple approval workflow  
4. `profiles` - User data
5. `notifications` - System notifications

**Why This is Better:**
- **Faster**: Fewer joins = better performance
- **Simpler**: One expense table instead of 4-5
- **Flexible**: JSON fields let you add new expense types without schema changes
- **PostgreSQL JSON is fast**: Properly indexed JSON performs as well as normalized tables
- **Maintainable**: 5 tables vs 15 tables
